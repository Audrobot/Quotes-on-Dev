# Quotes on Dev 

A WordPress theme replicated after 'Quotes on Dev'- a site inspired by Chris Coyier's "Quotes on Design". Quotes on Dev uses a custom Rest Api to randomly fetch and return posts when the 'Show me another' button is clicked.

## Instructions

Displayed on the Home page is a quote and button that on click generates another random quote. Pressing this button triggers an ajax request to the rest api, displaying a new random quote from the stored quotes contained in the blog posts section of the site. There is also an About page, Archives page--containing categories and tags--and Submit page. If user is logged in, a new quote can be submitted via an ajax post request.
